# Hola.
First things first, I am just getting into coding and this profile should be taken with a grain of salt. So don't rub it in your eyes too much!

My name is **Dominic** and my nickname _makitango_ originates from me supposedly looking like the maki from the Madagascar movie whenever I see Kinder Bueno chocolate bars (best served right from the fridge!) and having had a fascination for the same-named dance (not denying that the fascination has vanished though).

Contrary to the headline, my Spanish skills should not be tested. _(And cannot, or at least successfully.)_

My work experience has been this mostly:
- copywriting/editing
- UX design
- MDM, networking and general IT
- logistics
- AI/ML data analytics

You can lure me under a bridge with the following:
1. Spaghetti ice cream
2. Burrata on pizza
3. tragically spicy food making me cry like my mom during Dirty Dancing
4. fun sports like surfing, diving, winter sports and aerial out-of-plane activities _(preferably with parachutes)_

What am I proud of in my life?
- having a cascaded file structure on my desktop folder, dating back years
- cooking 3 min instant dishes for over 20 mins and pimping the crap out of them
- having gotten a PS5 during the early days
- the way I calculate the rent for my sub-tenants and display the information would make my ancestors proud, them believing once again in my math skills when looking down from the iCloud
